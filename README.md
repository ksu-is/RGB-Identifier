# color-selector-chrome-extenrion

This program is a chrome extension that will allow the user to click on a color from a website and pull the RGB information of the color. I will be pulling code from different repositories and modifying them accordingly to fit the parameters of my project.

To create the chrome extension, I will be using: https://github.com/PFython/pyscript-local-runtime To create the color selector, I will be watching various youtube videos on color wheels and selectors to build the code from that.
